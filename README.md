Description : This repo is our second assignment at SIB E-Commerce. This task is a data channel, where we fetch data i.e. from Twitter by using the provided Twitter API.
The step in this task is that we first perform the ETL (extract, transform, load) and ELT (extract, load, transform) processes. ETL/ELT itself is part of a complete data integration strategy.
